RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT

1. Security Enhancements
- Implement encryption for the async local database
- Current vulnerability: user data is stored in plaintext
- Recommended solution: 
  * Implement encryption/decryption layer before data persistence
  * Consider using AES encryption for stored data
  * Securely manage encryption keys
  * Ensure encrypted data can still be efficiently queried

2. Cloud Synchronization
- Develop cloud sync functionality for data backup and cross-device access
- Potential features:
  * Automatic background sync while maintaining async operations
  * Conflict resolution handling for offline changes
  * User authentication and secure data transfer
  * Progress retention across devices
  * Maintain local-first architecture with cloud as backup

3. Game Improvements
- Fix critical crash bug in end-game scenario
- Current issue: Application terminates unexpectedly upon game completion
- Enhance game variety and engagement:
  * Add difficulty levels
  * Implement achievement system
  * Create more cognitive training exercises
  * Include progress tracking and statistics

4. Smartwatch Integration
- Convert manual data input to automatic data collection
- Implement continuous heart rate monitoring
- Add automatic exercise detection
- Sync health metrics in real-time
- Consider adding:
  * Sleep tracking
  * Step counting
  * Activity recognition
  * Stress level monitoring

Priority Order:
1. Fix game crash bug (Critical)
2. Implement database encryption (Security)
3. Develop automatic smartwatch integration (User Experience)
4. Add cloud synchronization (Feature Enhancement)
